## How to

This code opens a file called "memory.dat" in read-write mode, reads 1024 bytes of data from the file into a buffer, modifies the data in the buffer by inverting each byte, writes the modified data back to the file, closes the file, and finally outputs a message indicating that the memory has been successfully read and edited. 

If there is an error opening the file, reading from the file, writing to the file, or closing the file, an error message is displayed and the program terminates with a non-zero exit code.
